# UFO

## Overview of Project

Providing a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.


## Results
Before filtering the webpage looks like this.

To search for date example 1/01/2010 and city name Phoenix at the same time, enter the date and the city in their respective search bars and it will filter data for the date and city provided. Then your view should be like this:

## Summary

One drawback of this design is the filter search. When a user is typing in the search bars, there should be an auto-fill option to make it easier for users when filtering a specific criteria and also there should be a drop down option when user begin to type to give users idea of the options available.
